Instructions

For the Blackened Chicken

Open all windows and turn all vents on high, this will smoke like a mofo. Melt butter and mix in blackened seasoning. Brush over chicken. Heat cast iron skillet over high heat for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium high and add chicken. Cook on each side until done. Remove from skillet and keep warm.

For the Alfredo Sauce & Pasta

Cook the pasta in a pot of boiling, salted water until al dente. Drain in a colander but reserve 1/4 cup of the pasta water. While the pasta is cooking, melt the butter in a medium sauce pan over medium-high heat. Add shallots and garlic and saute until tender. Add heavy cream and bring to a boil. Reduce to medium and cook, stirring often, until sauce has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper and the reserved cooking liquid, stir. Add in the cooked pasta and stir.

Slice reserved chicken.

Plate the pasta with the sliced chicken breast on top.

Garnish with parsley & ENJOY!
