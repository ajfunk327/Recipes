# Bourbon chicken

*from MyRecipes, modified*

* 3 tablespoons brown sugar
* 3 tablespoons honey bourbon (honey whiskey works too)
* 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 
* 1 tablespoon grated peeled fresh ginger 
* 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice (or more if you love lime like me)
* 3 garlic cloves, minced 
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* About a 1/4 of an orange worth of orange zest
* 2 chicken breasts

Combine first 8 ingredients in a bag or air-tight container. Marinade chicken breasts for a min. 30 up to a day. 

Take chicken out and drain. Make sure it's not sopping wet. Cook on medium to medium high, making sure to get good browning. Remove chicken and rest. Take sauce and put in pan, boil, and reduce until it is a glaze. Put chicken back in. Top with seasme seeds and green onion.
