# Fried Rice

*From reddit & trial and error*

Ingredients 

* Leftover white rice for this, around a day old. Maybe about 2-3 cups.
* 2 chicken breasts, cubed
* Two eggs
* Carrot
* Green onion
* White onion
* Any veggies you may want, really

Marinade
* 1/3 cup soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon of ginger, minced (I do more tho)
* 1 tablespoon garlic, minced (Again, I do more)
* 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon mirrin
* 1/2 tablespoon chili oil

Marinade chicken for a min. 30 min and maximum 24 hrs. 

For sauce, empty marinade in a pot and drain chicken in pot. Bring marinade to a boil. Leave boiling for about 3 minutes, bring down to a simmer. Leave in pot until the end. 

Prep veggies.  Heat cast iron wok (or any large pan really, just make sure it's ripping hot). Put neutral cooking oil OR seasame oil (this depends on how much you like seasame). Make sure chicken isn't drippy before putting in pan. Cook chicken, making sure to spoon out any excess sauce into the pot. Make sure you get a good brown too. Halfway thru, add onions. When done, put in bowl and set aside. Take a tablespoon or so of marinade and set aside to cool. Add carrot and onion, put in bowl when to desired taste. Whisk cooled sauce into eggs. Lower the heat and put the eggs in. Constantly swirl eggs in pan while they cook (should only be about a minute). Add rice and stir, breaking up the egg. Then, add chicken and veggies, and put however much sauce you think is appropriate to your rice. Add seasame and tops of green onion.
