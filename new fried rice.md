# New Fried Rice

* from trial and error*

* 4 cups leftover rice
* 4 cloves of garlic, chopped
* 1 large shallot, chopped
* 2 thai chilies, minced
* 2 eggs
* soy sauce, to taste
* msg, to taste
* green onion greens, to taste
* any leftover veggies/meat you may want to add

Have everything ready beforehand. Heat and season wok until smoking. Add garlic, shallot, and thai chili. Cook until fragent, barely a few minutes. 
Move garlic, shallot, and thai chili to sides of pan and add egg and scramble. Add rice, being sure to break it up. Add soy sauce and msg to taste. Garnish with green onions.

I like to add seasame oil at the end and some furikake. I also love adding mushrooms. 

Both types are good btw, just have different moods sometimes.
