# Pizza

*From mom*

__Dough__
* 1 tsp Dry Pizza Yeast (Fleischmann's)
* 1 tsp Honey
* 2/3 cup Warm Water
* 1 cup Flour (King Arthur)
* 1/4 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Olive Oil
* 3/4 to 1 cup Flour

Mix yeast, honey, and water. Let stand for 5 minutes.
Add flour. Then add salt and olive oil. Then add remaining flour.
Cover and let rise for at least an hour, or overnight in the fridge.
Put oven at highest it can go, trust me. Put a thin coating of oil on the bottom of a pan, cast iron is probably my favorite. Depending on the voodoo that is baking, bake for anywhere from 7 to 15 minutes. Until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is brown and bubbly.

__Sauce__
* Tomato Sauce 
* Salt
* Pepper
* Fresh Garlic
* Fresh Onion
* Italian Seasoning
* Olive Oil

Sorry, you're gonna have to grandma style this. Chop the garlic and onions. Add with sauce in a pan. Let simmer for at least an hour, but 3 is good. Add seasoning after simmer.
