# Roasted Broccoli

*From reddit*

* Broccoli crowns
* Salt, more than you think you need, all over the crowns
* White vinegar, two cap fulls maybe
* Healthy drizzle of good olive oil, enough to coat them but not enough to pool in the bowl
* Garlic, minced
* Ginger, pressed

Oven at 375, roast setting if you have it
Toss together. Put on a baking sheet. 
Roast for 20 minutes or so, until you smell it. Check every 15 minutes.
