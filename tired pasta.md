Cook pasta. While it's cooking, put olive oil in a pan. When it gets shimmering, put sliced garlic in. When garlic is getting golden, add red pepper flakes and lemon juice. Let get to know each other for a minute or so. Add about a 1/4th of a cup of pasta water. Add pasta and let get to know for a minute or so. Add fresh basil and shredded Parmesan at the end. Add pepper and salt, if needed. Enjoy.
